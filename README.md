## Java

### This repository reunites some lessons and solved challenges. For now there no much to present or see, but in the future I hope to put more content.

  * The lessons cover the basic concepts of the language and it serves as quick reference.
  * By solving these basics challenges has helped me to understand the syntax of the language.
  * In the future I want to create individual repositories for projects in Java.
